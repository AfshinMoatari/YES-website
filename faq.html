                      <p>We guarantee the qualifications of our teammates by conducting several interviews with candidates in our database.

                      <p>As a rule of thumb, we require at least 60 hours per month for our teammates to ensure a part-time position, also the service fee from the 60 hours gives us the ability to sponsor a single child for a month and pay off all required costs. We do understand that some positions equate to less than 60 hours a month and in these cases we occasionally make exceptions.</p>

                        <p>We spend an estimated 25% on social development. This covers child sponsorship and supporting social projects. We spend 15% on legal expenses, lawyer, accountant, insurance etc. We spend 55% on maintaining teammates as well as building upon the existing organizational structure. This leaves 5 % for unexpected costs and can be added to the “giveback” that we provide companies that hire through us for an extended period of time.</p>
