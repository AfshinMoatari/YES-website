                      <p>We are different in many ways. The main difference is that our vision with the company is not making profits for ourselves. It’s about making a social difference in Denmark but also around the world through various projects.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>The first step for any organisation or company wishing to hire through YESCPH is to write an email /call us with the details of the specific needs at yes@yescph.co/42444540.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>Our vision is to facilitate the integration of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants through active participation in the Danish labor market. Therefore, the teammates you can hire come from one of the groups mentioned above. Further,
                        we will always prioritise teammates that are in most need of our help.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>We guarantee the qualifications of our teammates by conducting several interviews with candidates in our database. Because we understand that some newcomers to Denmark might not have the industry experience, we will provide any training
                        sessions needed prior to them filling a job position.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>As a rule of thumb, we require at least 60 hours per month for our teammates to ensure a part-time position, also the service fee from the 60 hours gives us the ability to sponsor a single child for a month and pay off all required
                        costs. We do understand that some positions equate to less than 60 hours a month and in these cases, we occasionally make exceptions.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>There is no time limit as to how long you can have a teammate at your company. However, the minimum duration for a contract is six months, where the first month is a trial period to ensure we are a perfect partnership.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>The service guarantee is us promising that the position you need filling will always have a teammate there. Even if your appointed teammate is sick. We therefore promise to find a temporary replacement that is equally qualified.
                        The service guarantee also ensures that if you need an extra teammate with short notice we can fulfil this requirement.</p>

                      <hr class="uk-hidden break-large">
                      <p>Yes. We maintain a group of select teammates that can step in with three hours’ notice depending on the location of your workplace. If you use this part of our service, keep in mind that the wages are subject to a 20% increase because
                        to employee is “on call”. A service is considered last minute if you inform us of your need less than 24 hours before the need. If the need is an extension of the scheduled service, it is not considered last minute.</p>

                          building upon the existing organisational structure. This leaves 5 % for unexpected costs and can be added to the “giveback” that we provide companies that use our service.</p>
