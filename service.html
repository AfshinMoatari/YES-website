                    companies to interact with their teammates, which involves taking responsibility for their wellbeing and making sure that the areas where they work are safe. Furthermore, according to the Danish Business Authority the recipient company

                    be made. Therefore, this is our way of easing the minds of companies we work with in terms of potential mistakes made by teammates in their process of learning their way around the new place of work.</p>
