                  <hr class="uk-hidden break-small">
                  <em>Work injury insurance (Arbejdsskade forsikring)</em>
                  <p>This insurance covers injuries to the employee in the workplace. This is the part of the insurance that we ask companies we work with to handle. The nature of the work we do involves sustainable integration. As such, we encourage companies
                    to interact with their teammates, which involves taking responsibility for their wellbeing and making sure that the areas where they work are safe. Furthermore, according to the Danish Business Authority the recipient company is responsible
                    for providing the work injury insurance for the teammate working with them.</p>

                  <p>This insurance covers damage done by the teammate at the recipient company. It covers damages up to 10 million DKK. While we have not been forced to utilize this insurance, and hope that we never will, we understand that mistakes can
                    be made. Therefore, this is our way of easing the minds of companies we work with in terms of potential mistakes made by teammates in their process of learning their way around the new place of work.</p>
